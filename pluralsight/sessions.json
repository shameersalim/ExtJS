      "description": "When it comes to sending data across a network, applications send either binary or self-describing data (XML). Both approaches have merits. Data Distribution Service (DDS) combines the best of both in what’s called “data-centric messaging”. DDS shares the type description once, upfront, and later on sends binary data that meets the type description. You typically use IDL or XSD to specify the types and run them through a code generator for type-safe wrapper APIs for your application in your programming language. Simple and fast! As it turns out, however, C++11 bends the rules once again. In this presentation you will learn about a template-based C++11 messaging library that gives the DDS code generator a run for its money. The types and objects in your C++11 application are mapped to standard DDS type descriptions and serialized format, respectively, using template meta-programming. You may never like how SFINAE is pronounced but you won’t stop talking about it after you see “overloading in overdrive” in this talk. What’s more? I will share my newfound hatred for std::vector of bool/enums and built-in multi-dimensional arrays. We will talk about STL, Boost Fusion, variadic templates, enable_if, and scheduling office meetings. (That’s right!) For 90 minutes, you are in for some cool compile-time computation and network programming techniques.",

In addition, you'll be surprised how easily you can deploy and launch both hybrid and \"native\" Android apps to Google Glass (bring your device if you have one). Some CSS3-based 2D/3D graphics and animation effects are \"reasonable\" on Google Glass (a 640x360 pixel screen, 16GB storage, and a 5 megapixel camera). This session discusses the mechanics of porting a famous and classic animation game to CSS3, and then porting the game to Google Glass, along with the technical challenges of actually playing this game on Google Glass.\nWe'll also launch some apps on mobile devices, such as an iPad3 and a Nexus 7 2.\nIn addition, you'll learn how to create mobile applications with CSS3 effects in Eclipse: first without the use of a plugin, and second with PhoneGap 3.0, and then you can compare the two techniques.\n\nWe'll briefly look at an open source project for \"pure CSS3\" graphics/animation and another one that combines CSS3 with jQuery.\n\nWe'll also explore (if time permits) code samples for mobile applications that use HTML5 Canvas.\nThis session concludes with a book raffle of some of my books that have been published in 2013.\n",

Now, a bigger player wants to explore partnering.  So, you and your team start scoping tweaks to your product to integrate with the other company.  This could be great, bringing you tons of new users and revenue...  Or it could be a waste of time and resources.  Likewise, you have a shot at pitching or exhibiting at a major startup event.  You want to make the most of it.  So, you and your team plan product changes to satisfy the event’s organizers, audience or judges.  This could be great, bringing you acclaim from luminaries, press and prospective users...  Or it could be a waste of time and resources.  How do you decide what business development and marketing opportunities are real and worth pursuing?  How much do you diverge from your original product vision to satisfy a partner or event?  There’s a thin, gray, blurry line between being opportunistic and getting distracted.

Early in the transition, we decided to use REST as our RPC mechanism and JSON as our data interchange format.\n\nBefore we evaluated REST clients, we already were using Scala and Scalaz heavily, and built everything in the functional style. We decided to build our own REST client called Newman (http://github.com/stackmob/newman), also in the functional style.\n\nNewman shows how well the functional style is suited for representing REST semantics in code, and how it leads to safer code by the implementor and user.

They can simplify the persistence of complex data models and offer significantly better scalability and performance. However, using a NoSQL database means giving up the benefits of the relational model such as SQL, constraints and ACID transactions. For some applications, the solution is polyglot persistence: using SQL and NoSQL databases together.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn about the benefits and drawbacks of polyglot persistence and how to design applications that use this approach. We will explore the architecture and implementation of an example application that uses MySQL as the system of record and Redis as a very high-performance database that handles queries from the front-end.

However, traditional concurrency mechanisms are low-level, painful to use and error-prone.\n\nIn this talk you will learn about some powerful yet easy to use abstractions for consuming web services asynchronously.  We will compare the various implementations of futures that are available in Java, Scala and JavaScript.

Hopefully, we'll have an intellectually-stimulating discussion where everybody will learn something new and get a fresh perspective on how to make the most of their potential. ",

Writing clean code can significantly lower these costs. However, writing clean code also makes you more efficient during the initial development time and results in more stable code. You will be presented design patterns and best practices which will make you write better and more easily maintainable code, seeing code in a holistic way. You will learn how to apply them by using an existing implementation as the starting point of the presentation. Finally, patterns & practices benefits are explained.\n\nThis presentation is based on C# and Visual Studio 2012. However, the demonstrated patterns and practice can be applied to every other programming language too.",

However, writing clean code also makes you more efficient during the initial development time and results in more stable code. You will be presented design patterns and best practices which will make you write better and more easily maintainable code, seeing code in a holistic way. You will learn how to apply them by using an existing implementation as the starting point of the presentation. Finally, patterns & practices benefits are explained.\n\nThis presentation is based on C# and Visual Studio 2012. However, the demonstrated patterns and practice can be applied to every other programming language too.",

They are a standard features in a wide range of languages and popular tools, including Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, the .NET framework, PHP, and MySQL. Web servers such as Apache and IIS7 use them for URL rewriting. You can find them in tools and technologies as diverse as grep and egrep to Visual Studio. This talk will get you up and running with regular expressions. We will be discussing Regular Expressions as a language and cover the syntax with extensive demos. We will also cover the practical use of regular expressions by demonstrating best practices for writing, testing, performance optimization, readability, compilation, and design guidelines. We will use the .NET framework's flavor of regular expressions in the demos. However since .NET regular expressions like most regular expression libraries are Perl compatible, the syntax presented will generally work with a wide range of regular expression packages. The speaker will attempt to point out language variations for the major implementations.\n",

You have to worry about resources, collections of resources, pagination, query parameters, references to other resources, which HTTP Methods to use, HTTP Caching, security, and more! And you have to make sure it lasts and doesn't break clients as you add features over time. Further, while there are many references on creating REST APIs with XML, there are many fewer references for REST + JSON. In this presentation, Les Hazlewood - Stormpath CTO and Apache Shiro PMC Chair - will share all of the golden nuggets learned while designing, implementing and supporting JSON-based REST APIs, using examples from a clean real-world REST+JSON API. He will cover: -JSON-based data formats in a RESTful API -References to other JSON-based resources (aka 'linking'). -Resource collections and pagination -How to map (and how not to map) HTTP methods to Resource CRUD -Resource partial updates -Supporting HTTP Method Overloading for clients that don't support HTTP PUT and DELETE -API versioning strategies -Meaningful Error responses -Many-to-many resource relationships -HTTP Caching and Optimistic concurrency control. -Authentication and Security",

The ability to bake quality into your application as you develop it can change the way you think about software; it effects the way we approach, design and write applications. Test Driven Development is powerful. Yet many developers allow themselves to be intimidated by what they perceive as added complexity. Managers worry that the practice of \"test first\" will delay development. This presentation will explain the concepts behind TDD, outline the benefits, give you some concrete examples of how to do TDD using the C# language and some advice on how to sell it to your managers.(Enter the description of your session here)",

      "description": "This session is designed to give you a solid understanding of underpinnings and principles of Hadoop, perhaps the most sought after high-paying skill for a developer today.  The in-depth session will begin by illustrating on how you build your own single node cluster of Hadoop on the Linux virtual machine (CentOS) for free so you can start learning immediately. The session will begin with a raw Linux VM and all the needed components will be downloaded and installed. You can be up and running quickly in the cloud within 30 minutes.  This session will contain code and will show no more than a few slides. We will learn about writing the low-level map/reduce code in Java, which is really the low-level assembly language of Hadoop code. From there we will introduce more efficient approaches to analyzing big data with Hadoop, running high level queries and analyzing crime information from San Francisco as the example.  We will create tables, import data, and group crime types all with a simple SQL like interface that is Hive.  Finally, we will include a brief talk on PIG as well to round out the high level programming models and additional follow up materials so you can be up to speed on one of the most promising and financially rewarding skills today.",

      "description": "Two years ago I gave a talk on PlayFramework with Java at SVCC. As with everything, PlayFramework has evolved into a far mature ecosystem with native Scala support, and Typesafe backing. PlayFramework 2 is a simple, MVC-based, convention over configuration web application framework for Java and Scala. It is rapidly gaining popularity as more and more companies are adopting it for building scalable, performant, share-nothing architectures.\n\nIn this talk I'll cover the fundamentals of Play! Framework2, a brief overview of Scala, and demonstrate building a simple, RESTful API. This will be a very interactive, and hands-on session. \n\nIt'd be awesome if you have played around with Scala, but if you have not, the scope of this talk does not require you to be a Scala expert. It will however be very useful if you've worked with other Web Application Frameworks like Jersey, CXF, etc. so you can cross-relate the concepts. ",

Every platform has their own native option for app development. The problem with that approach is you greatly increase cost and code reuse is generally at a minimum and you generally have to learn a new language in the process thus increasing the time to market. In this talk I’ll take you through solutions available to develop, publish, and monetize your HTML/JS applications in the app economy and as an added bonus, how to cloud enable your HTML/JS apps.

Does this mean .NET is not suitable for this domain?\nIn this talk, I'll explain why I think it can be, as long as you use the right language for the job, namely F#.\nF# is a functional first language, with a concise and expressive syntax that will feel familiar to data scientists used to Python or Matlab. It combines the performance and maintenability benefits of statically typed languages, with the flexibility of Type Providers, a unique mechanism that enables the seamless consumption of virtually any datasources. And as a first-class .NET citizen, it interops smoothly with C#.\nSo if you are interested in a language that can handle both flexible data exploration, and the pressure of a real production system, come check out what F# has to offer!",

It was merged into the core framework in 2009 and since then we've seen a slew of new Java configuration-powered DSLs pop up. 2013, in particular, has seen alpha-or-better cuts of Java configuration support for Spring MVC, Spring Security (and Spring Security OAuth), Spring Batch, Spring Social, Spring Data (including all the modules under it: REST, MongoDB, JPA, Neo4j, Redis, etc), Spring HATEOAS, and more all provide milestone-or-better cuts of a Java configuration integration. Tomcat 7 (and all Servlet 3-compatible containers) offer a programmatic alternative to web.xml. This provides another great integration hook for modules that wish to integrate with the web container, removing the configuration burden from the user. There's a lot of power here and it's easy to get started if you know what to look for. In this talk, join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long and Spring-core commmitter, all-around nice guy, and Spring Boot ninja Phil Webb as they introduce the Java configuration support in the various Spring projects, show how to approach them when integrating them into your code, and - if the situation demands - how to write your own Java configuration DSL.",

      "description": "Unity is the currently most popular game development engine, providing both extensive tools as well as a powerful rending engine to enable a wide range of games on virtually all current platforms – including iOS, Android, Windows Store, Mac OS X, PlayStation, Xbox and many more. Major games like Deus Ex: The Fall, Angry Birds: The Piggies or Dead Trigger 2 were developed using Unity. Unity’s free edition and support for three programming languages (C#, JavaScript & Boo) makes the engine one of the best entries into game development. A powerful ecosystem, filled with many low-cost assets, many service providers and an virtually unlimited amount of education material available for free, enables big studios to cut down development time – and indie developers to build successful games. \n\nAround four months ago I decided that 'd like to extend my JavaScript skills and get into game development. Today, my first game \"Awesome Zombie Sniper\" (http://bit.ly/12PNGEM) gets around 6,000 new players each day on Windows Store alone – and is probably the most fun and exciting side project I have personally done to date. In this session, I’ll give a 101 introduction into game development for both JavaScript and C# developers alike, while also presenting some of the learnings I have made as a moonlight indie game developer. \n\nIf you’re in any way interested in games and have some experience with JavaScript, this session will enable you to code your first simple game and publish it to players world wide.

Unity’s free edition and support for three programming languages (C#, JavaScript & Boo) makes the engine one of the best entries into game development. A powerful ecosystem, filled with many low-cost assets, many service providers and an virtually unlimited amount of education material available for free, enables big studios to cut down development time – and indie developers to build successful games. \n\nAround four months ago I decided that 'd like to extend my JavaScript skills and get into game development. Today, my first game \"Awesome Zombie Sniper\" (http://bit.ly/12PNGEM) gets around 6,000 new players each day on Windows Store alone – and is probably the most fun and exciting side project I have personally done to date. In this session, I’ll give a 101 introduction into game development for both JavaScript and C# developers alike, while also presenting some of the learnings I have made as a moonlight indie game developer. \n\nIf you’re in any way interested in games and have some experience with JavaScript, this session will enable you to code your first simple game and publish it to players world wide.

Come see how it works from the inside out, watching what happens in the internals when you push your application to the cloud. You'll learn about the components inside Cloud Foundry and see them coordinate to manage the state of an application. You'll also see how containers enforce usage quotas and keep noisy neighbors well-behaved.
